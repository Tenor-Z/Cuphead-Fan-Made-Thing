# Cuphead-Fan-Made-Thing
As the name suggests, it's a fan made Cuphead boss fight game I made in 2017.

# Overview
This was originally a Scratch project I made in 2017 as a dumb kid. Because of how shitty the compilation of this project is, and my lack of proper bug fixing at the time, this project sucks and
remains unfinished and janky. It's playable, but it is unfair and you probably won't win lol (I don't even know if it's possible since the controls are ass)

This is essentially a fan made boss fight I made using a random grim reaper-esque character I came up with. I tried to make it as game-accurate as possible, though I suck at graphic design using Scratch's tools best representing MS Paint.

# The various bugs in the program (Oh noooo)
* Everything pretty much kills you in one hit
* Controls are sticky
* The jump sucks and barely avoids stuff
* I don't even know if you can beat this or what happens when you reach the end
* The title cards barely make sense

# My verdict
What was I thinking?
